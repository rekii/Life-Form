# Life Form
The life form project is a mini archive of a set of primitive rules for the composition of ambient motions.

The project was created for our presentation at VIS Arts Program 2014, to demonstrate the affective affordance of fields of motion (or in our word, motionscapes) that reside in virtual worlds.
